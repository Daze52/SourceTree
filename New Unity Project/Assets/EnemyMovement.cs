	/* **************Explanation and Hints************ 
    * FindGameObjectWithTag - This will find a GameObject with a specific tag. In this case we are using it to get a reference to the player.
    *                         You can do this by typing out the following
    *
    *                         *nameOfPlayerVariable* = GameObject.FindGameObjectWithTag("EnterPlayerTagHere");
    *
    * Getting a reference to the enemy damage script - You can do this the same way as getting the rigidbody except you replace "rigidbody" for
    *                                                  the name of the script. For example:
    *                                                   
    *                                                  *enemyDamageVariableName* = GetComponent<*enemyDamageScriptName*>();
    *
    * Comparing the type of enemy - In order to figure out what type of enemy this is we need to use the enemy damage variable from above.
    *                               Then we use the dot operator to access the type variable in that script. After the double equals we need
    *                               to use the enemy damage variable once again to access the enum we are comparing the type to.
    *
    * LookAt - The LookAt function rotates this GameObject to face a target. In this case we want to rotate the enemy so that it is facing the player.
    *          We can do this by typing the following:
    *          
    *          transform.LookAt(*nameOfPlayerVariable*.transform);
